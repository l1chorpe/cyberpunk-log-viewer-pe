# Cyberpunk Log Viewer (Preem Edition)

### What's this?

Cyberpunk Log Viewer is a utility for Cyberpunk: 2077. If your game isn't modded, it's probably useless. Otherwise, it might save you half a headache when you're trying to locate logs when the game crashes.

### What makes it preem?

It's a complete rewrite of the original app. I coded it in a way that makes it much more modular. In simpler terms: faster, more flexible updates.

### How does it work?

Just run the app, locate the game folder, and it'll do the rest. Double-click to open logs, or right-click to have more options. Settings can be accessed by clicking on the gear icon in the top right corner.

### How do I install it?

On the [releases](https://github.com/l1chorpe/cyberpunk-log-viewer-pe/releases) page, just pick and download the version you want (latest recommended).

### What's next?

Fixing the UI gets the priority for now. It's a bit inconsistent, which makes it horrible in my eyes. After that, I'll go right back into adding new features, make that settings page useful.
